### Student: Laura Turk

### Project Name: Flash-Card Me!

#### Check In: 1  

#### Project Pitch  
Using Google Vision API and Google Translate create a web app ideal for language learners looking to keep track of all those new words they're learning! The app will allow them to take a picture of text, extract a word/sentence they don't understand for translation/definition and create a flash card with the word/phrase and translation to be saved for future review.

### Deliverables  

#### Stack:
express (node?) backend to keep user's card decks
react-redux


#### APIs:  
* [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
* [Google Translate](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/)
* [OED](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) - limited requests for free version. use for spanish definitions
* [Google Vision in javascript tutorial](http://terrenceryan.com/blog/index.php/working-with-cloud-vision-api-from-javascript/)

### Reflection  

#### Order Of Attack  
1. build out translation PAGE
2. create card based on translation
3. save card in card Decks
4. mutate card decks
5. user sign in
6. advanced language settings

#### MVP
functioning react-redux app that allows text input, translates it and creates a flashcard that can be used in a flashcard 'deck'. User's cards are saved. google translate API is used.

#### Nice To Haves   
google vision API
advanced language options (separate API?) that offer monolingual definitions in place of translations

#### Biggest Challenges  
I believe my biggest challenges will be:
- learning/building express/backend
- not falling down rabbit holes
- google vision API

1. My mentor
2. Express docs/tutorials
3. google cloud platform documentation
